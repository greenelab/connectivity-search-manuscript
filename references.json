The Bioteque integrates, harmonizes, and formats data collected from over 150 data sources, including 12 biological entities (e.g., genes, diseases, drugs) linked by 67 types of associations (e.g., ‘drug treats disease’, ‘gene interacts with gene’). We show how Bioteque descriptors facilitate the assessment of high-throughput protein-protein interactome data, the prediction of drug response and new repurposing opportunities, and demonstrate that they can be used off-the-shelf in downstream machine learning tasks without loss of performance with respect to using original data. The Bioteque thus offers a thoroughly processed, tractable, and highly optimized assembly of the biomedical knowledge available in the public domain.</jats:p>",

Advances in data fusion and computational modeling have independently progressed towards addressing this issue. Here, we capitalize on both these approaches with Rosalind, a comprehensive gene prioritization method that combines heterogeneous knowledge graph construction with relational inference via tensor factorization to accurately predict disease-gene links. Rosalind demonstrates an increase in performance of 18%-50% over five comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. On historical data, Rosalind prospectively identifies 1 in 4 therapeutic relationships eventually proven true. Beyond efficacy, Rosalind is able to accurately predict clinical trial successes (75% recall at rank 200) and distinguish likely failures (74% recall at rank 200). Lastly, Rosalind predictions were experimentally tested in a patient-derived <jats:italic>in-vitro</jats:italic> assay for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which yielded 5 promising genes, one of which is unexplored in RA.</jats:p>",

Machine learning approaches are being investigated to help improve the effectiveness and speed of multiple stages of the drug discovery pipeline. Of these, those that use Knowledge Graphs (KG) have promise in many tasks, including drug repurposing, drug toxicity prediction and target gene–disease prioritization. In a drug discovery KG, crucial elements including genes, diseases and drugs are represented as entities, while relationships between them indicate an interaction. However, to construct high-quality KGs, suitable data are required. In this review, we detail publicly available sources suitable for use in constructing drug discovery focused KGs. We aim to help guide machine learning and KG practitioners who are interested in applying new techniques to the drug discovery field, but who may be unfamiliar with the relevant data sources. The datasets are selected via strict criteria, categorized according to the primary type of information contained within and are considered based upon what information could be extracted to build a KG. We then present a comparative analysis of existing public drug discovery KGs and an evaluation of selected motivating case studies from the literature. Additionally, we raise numerous and unique challenges and issues associated with the domain and its datasets, while also highlighting key future research directions. We hope this review will motivate KGs use in solving key and emerging questions in the drug discovery domain.</jats:p>",

Computational repositioning methods, particularly non-black-box methods that can account for and predict a drug’s mechanism, may provide great benefit for directing future development. By tuning both data and algorithm to utilize relationships important to drug mechanisms, a computational repositioning algorithm can be trained to both predict and explain mechanistically novel indications.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>In this work, we examined the 123 curated drug mechanism paths found in the drug mechanism database (DrugMechDB) and after identifying the most important relationships, we integrated 18 data sources to produce a heterogeneous knowledge graph, MechRepoNet, capable of capturing the information in these paths. We applied the Rephetio repurposing algorithm to MechRepoNet using only a subset of relationships known to be mechanistic in nature and found adequate predictive ability on an evaluation set with AUROC value of 0.83. The resulting repurposing model allowed us to prioritize paths in our knowledge graph to produce a predicted treatment mechanism. We found that DrugMechDB paths, when present in the network were rated highly among predicted mechanisms. We then demonstrated MechRepoNet’s ability to use mechanistic insight to identify a drug’s mechanistic target, with a mean reciprocal rank of 0.525 on a test set of known drug–target interactions. Finally, we walked through repurposing examples of the anti-cancer drug imatinib for use in the treatment of asthma, and metolazone for use in the treatment of osteoporosis, to demonstrate this method’s utility in providing mechanistic insight into repurposing predictions it provides.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The Python code to reproduce the entirety of this analysis is available at: https://github.com/SuLab/MechRepoNet (archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6456335).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The graph is built on the framework of 11 ontologies that maintain its structure, enable mappings and facilitate navigation. SPOKE is built weekly by python scripts which download each resource, check for integrity and completeness, and then create a ‘parent table’ of nodes and edges. Graph queries are translated by a REST API and users can submit searches directly via an API or a graphical user interface.

Although there are abundant experimental studies and computational efforts to obtain the candidate genes of diseases, the identification of symptom genes is rarely addressed. We curated a high-quality benchmark dataset of symptom-gene associations and proposed a heterogeneous network embedding for identifying symptom genes.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We proposed a heterogeneous network embedding representation algorithm, which constructed a heterogeneous symptom-related network that integrated symptom-related associations and applied an embedding representation algorithm to obtain the low-dimensional vector representation of nodes. By measuring the relevance between symptoms and genes via calculating the similarities of their vectors, the candidate genes of given symptoms can be obtained.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>A benchmark dataset of 18 270 symptom-gene associations between 505 symptoms and 4549 genes was curated. We compared our method to baseline algorithms (FSGER and PRINCE). The experimental results indicated our algorithm achieved a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art method, with precision and recall improved by 66.80% (0.844 vs 0.506) and 53.96% (0.311 vs 0.202), respectively, for TOP@3 and association precision improved by 37.71% (0.723 vs 0.525) over the PRINCE.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The experimental validation of the algorithms and the literature validation of typical symptoms indicated our method achieved excellent performance. Hence, we curated a prediction dataset of 17 479 symptom-candidate genes. The benchmark and prediction datasets have the potential to promote investigations of the molecular mechanisms of symptoms and provide candidate genes for validation in experimental settings.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

However, even with these advances, the number of compounds successfully repositioned via computational screening remains low. New strategies for algorithm evaluation that more accurately reflect the repositioning potential of a compound could provide a better target for future optimizations.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Using a text-mined database, we applied a previously described network-based computational repositioning algorithm, yielding strong results via cross-validation, averaging 0.95 AUROC on test-set indications. However, to better approximate a real-world scenario, we built a time-resolved evaluation framework. At various time points, we built networks corresponding to prior knowledge for use as a training set, and then predicted on a test set comprised of indications that were subsequently described. This framework showed a marked reduction in performance, peaking in performance metrics with the 1985 network at an AUROC of .797. Examining performance reductions due to removal of specific types of relationships highlighted the importance of drug-drug and disease-disease similarity metrics. Using data from future timepoints, we demonstrate that further acquisition of these kinds of data may help improve computational results.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Evaluating a repositioning algorithm using indications unknown to input network better tunes its ability to find emerging drug indications, rather than finding those which have been randomly withheld.

Within that project and the broader field, there is a need for a framework that can efficiently and reproducibly build an integrated, standards-compliant, and comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph that can be downloaded in standard serialized form or queried via a public application programming interface (API).</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>\n                           <jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>\n                        </jats:title>\n                <jats:p>To create a <jats:italic>knowledge provider</jats:italic> system within the Translator project, we have developed RTX-KG2, an open-source software system for building—and hosting a web API for querying—a biomedical knowledge graph that uses an Extract-Transform-Load approach to integrate 70 knowledge sources (including the aforementioned core six sources) into a knowledge graph with provenance information including (where available) citations. The semantic layer and schema for RTX-KG2 follow the standard Biolink model to maximize interoperability. RTX-KG2 is currently being used by multiple Translator reasoning agents, both in its downloadable form and via its SmartAPI-registered interface. Serializations of RTX-KG2 are available for download in both the pre-canonicalized form and in canonicalized form (in which synonyms are merged). The current canonicalized version (KG2.7.3) of RTX-KG2 contains 6.4M nodes and 39.3M edges with a hierarchy of 77 relationship types from Biolink.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>\n                           <jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>\n                        </jats:title>\n                <jats:p>RTX-KG2 is the first knowledge graph that integrates UMLS, SemMedDB, ChEMBL, DrugBank, Reactome, SMPDB, and 64 additional knowledge sources within a knowledge graph that conforms to the Biolink standard for its semantic layer and schema.

But traditional genetic localization methods are often technique-difficulty and time-consuming. With the development of computer science, computational biology has gradually become one of the main methods for finding candidate pathogenic genes.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We propose a pathogenic genes prediction method based on network embedding which is called Multipath2vec. Firstly, we construct an heterogeneous network which is called <jats:italic>GP</jats:italic>−network. It is constructed based on three kinds of relationships between genes and phenotypes, including correlations between phenotypes, interactions between genes and known gene-phenotype pairs. Then in order to embedding the network better, we design the multi-path to guide random walk in <jats:italic>GP</jats:italic>−network. The multi-path includes multiple paths between genes and phenotypes which can capture complex structural information of heterogeneous network. Finally, we use the learned vector representation of each phenotype and protein to calculate the similarities and rank according to the similarities between candidate genes and the target phenotype.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We implemented Multipath2vec and four baseline approaches (i.e., CATAPULT, PRINCE, Deepwalk and Metapath2vec) on many-genes gene-phenotype data, single-gene gene-phenotype data and whole gene-phenotype data. Experimental results show that Multipath2vec outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines in pathogenic genes prediction task.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We propose Multipath2vec that can be utilized to predict pathogenic genes and experimental results show the higher accuracy of pathogenic genes prediction.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

Several translation-based algorithms, including TransE, TransH, TransR, TransD, and TranSparse, have been proposed to learn effective embedding vectors from typical knowledge graphs in which the relations between head and tail entities are deterministic. However, in medical knowledge graphs, the relations between head and tail entities are inherently probabilistic.

    "abstract": "Hetionet v1.0 is a hetnet (heterogeneous network) with 47,031 nodes of 11 types and 2,250,197 relationships of 24 types. This record contains computed connectivity measurements for Hetionet v1.0 for all metapaths (types of paths) up to length 3. These measurements are designed to assess the extent of connectivity between two nodes along a given metapath. Several types of data are included: <strong>Path counts</strong>: Path counts measure the number of paths from a source node to a target node along a specified metapath. The path count is a special case of the degree-weighted path count (DWPC) metric where the damping exponent parameter is set to 0.0. Path counts for all source–target node combinations of a given metapath are stored in a matrix with source nodes as rows and target nodes as columns. <strong>Degree-weighted path counts</strong>: DWPCs measure the abundance of paths from a source to target node along a given metapath (like path counts), but are adjusted for the degrees along the path such that paths through higher degree nodes are downweighted according to a damping parameter. The DWPCs here use a damping exponent of 0.5 and the same matrix serialization as the path count datasets. The values are not scaled/transformed. To compare to the null DWPCs discussed below, divide each value by the mean DWPC for the entire matrix and apply an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation. <strong>Degree-grouped permutation summaries</strong>: Degree-grouped permutations (DGP) are used to compute the significance of DWPC values. Specifically, they are used to estimate null distribution for DWPCs from the unpermuted hetnet. DGP summaries provide summary statistics of DWPCs computed on permuted hetnets. The permuted hetnets are derived from Hetionet v1.0 using the XSwap algorithm. This approach preserves node degree but randomizes edges to muddle their meaning. DWPCs were computed for 200 permuted networks and grouped by source–target node degree within each metapath. Permuted DWPCs were scaled by dividing by the unpermuted DWPC mean and then inverse hyperbolic sine transformed. Every degree pair for a given metapath has corresponding statistics that summarize its values across permuted hetnets. These statistics include the number of observed DWPCs, the number of nonzero DWPCs, the sum of the DWPCs, and the sum of squared DWPCs. These values are sufficient to calculate the parameters of a gamma-hurdle null DWPC distribution. <strong>Data Format</strong>: the .zip files are HetMat archive files. This simply means that the directory structure and file formats of the archived files conform to the HetMat data structure for storing hetnets on disk. Matrices are stored as scipy.sparse .npz files. .npz is a numpy array serialization format that scipy uses to write sparse matrices to disk. TSV files in this upload report information on the contents of the archives. The .zip-info.tsv files contain a list of all files included in the zip archives. metapath-dwpc-stats.tsv contains summary information on the unpermuted path counts and DWPCs. Note that results are archived by path length, such that all metapaths of length 1 are in a different archive than metapaths of length 2. Therefore, users who only need results for shorter metapaths, do not need to download the large archives for longer metapaths. There are 24 metapaths of length 1, 242 metapaths of length 2, and 1939 metapaths of length 3. <strong>Connectivity Search Database</strong>: connectivity-search-pg_dump.sql.gz is a PostgreSQL database dump for use with the connectivity-search-backend repository. <strong>Source code</strong>: These datasets were computed by the bulk.ipynb notebook from greenelab/hetmech@34e95b9. <strong>Funding</strong>: This work was supported through a research collaboration with Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development. This work is funded in part by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation’s Data-Driven Discovery Initiative through Grants GBMF4552 and GBMF4560. <strong>More information</strong>: See the manuscript titled Hetnet connectivity search provides rapid insights into how two biomedical entities are related.",

This study describes Project Rephetio to systematically model drug efficacy based on 755 existing treatments. First, we constructed Hetionet (neo4j.het.io), an integrative network encoding knowledge from millions of biomedical studies. Hetionet v1.0 consists of 47,031 nodes of 11 types and 2,250,197 relationships of 24 types. Data were integrated from 29 public resources to connect compounds, diseases, genes, anatomies, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, pharmacologic classes, side effects, and symptoms. Next, we identified network patterns that distinguish treatments from non-treatments. Then, we predicted the probability of treatment for 209,168 compound–disease pairs (het.io/repurpose). Our predictions validated on two external sets of treatment and provided pharmacological insights on epilepsy, suggesting they will help prioritize drug repurposing candidates. This study was entirely open and received realtime feedback from 40 community members.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Recently, knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) have received significant attention, and several software libraries have been developed for training and evaluation. While each of them addresses specific needs, we report on a  community effort to a re-design and re-implementation of  PyKEEN, one of the early KGE libraries.  PyKEEN 1.0 enables users to compose knowledge graph embedding models based on a wide range of interaction models, training approaches, loss functions, and permits the explicit modeling of inverse relations. It allows users to measure each component's influence individually on the model's performance. Besides, an automatic memory optimization has been realized in order to optimally exploit the provided hardware. Through the integration of Optuna, extensive hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) functionalities are provided.",
