### DWPC null distribution

To assess connectivity between a source and target node, we use the DWPC (degree-weighted path count) metric.
The DWPC is similar to path count (number of paths between the source and target node along a given metapath), except that it downweights paths through high degree nodes.
Rather than using the raw DWPC for a source-metapath-target combination, we transform the DWPC across all source-target node pairs for a metapath to yield a distribution that is more compact and amenable to modeling.

Previously, we had no technique for detecting whether a DWPC value was exceptional.
One possibility is to evaluate the DWPCs for all pairs of nodes and select the top scores (e.g. the top 5% of DWPCs).
Another possibility is to pick a transformed DWPC score as a cutoff.
The shortcoming of these methods is twofold.
First, neither the percentile nor absolute value of a DWPC has inherent meaning.
To select transformed DWPCs greater than 6, or alternatively the top 1% of DWPCs, is arbitrary.
Second, comparing DWPCs between node pairs fails to account for the situation where high-degree node pairs are likely to score higher, solely on account of their degree (TODO: figure).

To address these shortcomings, we developed a method to compute the right-tail _p_-value of a DWPC.
_p_-values have a broadly understood interpretation --- in our case, the probability that a DWPC equal to or greater than the observed DWPC could occur by chance.
By tailoring the null distribution for a DWPC to the degree of its source and target node, we are able to account for degree effects when determining the significance of a DWPC.
