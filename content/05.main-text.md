## Introduction {.page_break_before}

A *network* (also known as a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics))) is a conceptual representation of a group of entities — called *nodes* — and the relationships between them — called *edges*.
Typically, a network has only one type of node and one type of edge.
But in many cases, it is necessary to be able to distinguish between different types of entities and relationships.

### Hetnets

A *hetnet* (short for **het**erogeneous information **net**work [@doi:10.15363/thinklab.d104]) is a network where nodes and edges have type.
The ability to differentiate between different types of entities and relationships allows a hetnet to accurately describe more complex data.
Hetnets are particularly useful in biomedicine, where it is important to capture the conceptual distinctions between various concepts,
such as genes and diseases, or upregulation and binding.

The types of nodes and edges in a hetnet are defined by a schema, referred to as a metagraph.
The metagraph consists of metanodes (types of nodes) and metaedges (types of edges).
Note that the prefix *meta* is used to refer to type (e.g. compound),
as opposed to a specific node/edge/path itself (e.g. acetaminophen).

### Hetionet

[Hetionet](https://het.io/about/) is a knowledge graph of human biology, disease, and medicine, integrating information from millions of studies and decades of research.
Hetionet v1.0 combines information from [29 public databases](https://git.dhimmel.com/rephetio-manuscript/#tbl:resources).
The network contains 47,031 nodes of [11 types](https://git.dhimmel.com/rephetio-manuscript/#tbl:metanodes) (Table @tbl:metanodes) and 2,250,197 edges of [24 types](https://git.dhimmel.com/rephetio-manuscript/#tbl:metaedges).

Table: **Node types in Hetionet**
The abbreviation, number of nodes, and description for each of the 11 metanodes in Hetionet v1.0.
{#tbl:metanodes}

Hetionet provides a foundation for building hetnet applications.
It unifies data from several different, disparate sources into a single, comprehensive, accessible, common-format network.
The database is publicly accessible without login at <https://neo4j.het.io>.
The Neo4j graph database enables querying Hetionet using the Cypher language,
which was designed to interact with networks where nodes and edges have both types and properties.

One limitation that restricts the applicability of Hetionet is incompleteness.
In many cases, Hetionet v1.0 includes only a subset of the nodes from a given resource.
For example, the Disease Ontology contains over 9,000 diseases [@doi:10.1093/nar/gky1032], while Hetionet includes only 137 diseases [@doi:10.15363/thinklab.d44].
Nodes were excluded to avoid redundant or overly specific nodes, while ensuring a minimum level of connectivity for compounds and diseases.
See the [Project Rephetio methods](https://git.dhimmel.com/rephetio-manuscript/#nodes) for more details [@rephetio].
Nonetheless, Hetionet v1.0 remains one of the most comprehensive and integrative networks that consolidates biomedical knowledge into a manageable number of node and edge types.
Other integrative resources, some still under development, include [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) [@doi:10.7554/eLife.52614], [SemMedDB](https://skr3.nlm.nih.gov/SemMedDB/) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts591; @doi:10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621568; @doi:10.1186/s12859-019-3297-0], [SPOKE](https://spoke.ucsf.edu/), and [DRKG](https://github.com/gnn4dr/DRKG).
