## Introduction {.page_break_before}

A *network* (also known as a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics))) is a conceptual representation of a group of things — called *nodes* — and the relationships between them — called *edges*.
Typically, a network has only one type of node and one type of edge.
But in many cases, it is necessary to be able to distinguish between different types of entities and relationships.

### Hetnets

A *hetnet* (short for **het**erogeneous information **net**work [@doi:10.15363/thinklab.d104]) is a network where nodes and edges can be multiple types.
This additional dimension allows a hetnet to accurately describe more complex data.
Hetnets are particularly useful in biomedicine, where it is important to capture the conceptual distinctions between various components and mechanisms,
such as genes and diseases, or upregulation and binding.

The prefix *meta* is used in this study to refer to the type of the node/edge (e.g. compound),
as opposed to the specific node/edge itself (e.g. acetaminophen).

### Hetionet

[Hetionet](https://het.io/about/) is a knowledge graph of human biology, disease, and medicine, integrating information from millions of studies and decades of research.
Hetionet v1.0 combines information from [29 public databases](https://git.dhimmel.com/rephetio-manuscript/#tbl:resources).
The network contains 47,031 nodes of [11 types](https://git.dhimmel.com/rephetio-manuscript/#tbl:metanodes) (Table @tbl:metanodes) and 2,250,197 edges of [24 types](https://git.dhimmel.com/rephetio-manuscript/#tbl:metaedges).

| Symptom | S | 438 | Signs and Symptoms (i.e. clinical abnormalities that can indicate a medical condition). From the [MeSH ontology](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html). |

Table: **Node types in Hetionet**
The abbreviation, number of nodes, and description for each of the 11 node types (metanodes) in Hetionet v1.0.
In many cases, Hetionet v1.0 includes only a subset of the nodes from a given resource.
For example, the Disease Ontology contains over 9,000 diseases [@doi:10.1093/nar/gky1032], while Hetionet includes only 137 diseases [@doi:10.15363/thinklab.d44].
Nodes were excluded to remove redundant or overly specific nodes, ensure a minimum level of connectivity for compounds and diseases.
